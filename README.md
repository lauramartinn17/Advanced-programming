#Tasks day2:
- Move Frog class to another file, as we did for the Car class
- We defined the function moveUp for the Frog. Define also the functions
  moveLeft() and MoveRight() for the Frog. Make them working so when pressing -> or <- the frog moves in the that direction
- Add an extra parameter to the Lane constructor to define the speed of all the cars of the Lane
  
#Tasks day3:
-Paint the cars with a "fill" color. Every Lane will have all its cars painted in the same color. So you have to add 1 more parameter to the Lane constructor that defines the cars' color.
-Add 1 more parameter to the Lane constructor to define the width of all its cars, so you can define cars, lorries (longer cars), etc.
-When the frog crashes a car, set the frog at its starting position (400,500)

#Tasks day4:
- When the frog reaches the top of the screen, display a score calculated from "100-time"
- When frog reaches the top of the screen, the game should pause.
- Pressing "p", the game should pause
- If possible, display in the middle of the screen the message "YOU WON!!!" when winning
- If possible, using the libary PIL (pip install pillow), you can replace the rectangle of the frog by an image
